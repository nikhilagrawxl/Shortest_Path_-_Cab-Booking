# Shortest_Path_-_Cab-Booking
INTRODUCTION 
With so many cities in India if anyone want to know the path and about the cabs between  them. The correct information is very important. The shortest path search is a problem to  find a path between two nodes with a minimum number of weights, in the case of searching  the fastest path between two locations on the map to travel between the two locations. One  of the methods used to solve the problem of running the shortest path using the Dijkstra  algorithm, the Dijkstra algorithm is the algorithm for finding the cheapest path from an initial  vertex to the last vertex, this algorithm is based on the greedy technique. The Dijkstra  algorithm will search for the shortest path starting from the initial node to the destination  node and this algorithm will compare the smallest weight from the initial node to the  destination node to find the most efficient path and at last if anyone wants to know about  the cab can also get it. 

BACKGROUND SOFTWARE IDEAS 
C++, Microsoft Visual Code, Code Blocks

THE PURPOSE AND BENEFITS OF SOFTWARE  DEVELOPMENT 
The benefits of this program are by showing the route between the cities with the shortest  possible distance and effectively reach the tourist destination and if anyone wants to travel  by cab can also book with it. 

DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM 
The shortest route search includes in-graph theory material. The very algorithm famous for  solving this problem is Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm was invented by a Dutch  computer scientist who was named Edsger Dijkstra. Figure 1 below is the pseudo code of  Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra is the algorithm used to find the shortest path on a graph  directed An example of implementing the Dijkstra algorithm is the shortest path that  connects between the two different cities (Single-source Single-destination Shortest Path  Problems). Procedure Dijkstra's algorithm uses a greedy strategy, where at each step, the  side with the smallest weight is selected which connects an already node selected with  other vertices that have not been selected. Dijkstra's algorithm requires parameters of the  place of origin and place of destination. This result is the shortest distance from the place of  origin to the destination and its  route. 

BACKTRACKING ALGORITHM 
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a  solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the  constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed  till reaching any level of the search tree). 

GREEDY ALGORITHM 
Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing  the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where  choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy. DP ALGORITHM Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a  recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic  Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not  have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time  complexities from exponential to polynomial. For example, if we write simple recursive  solution for Fibonacci Numbers, we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by  storing solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear. 

ANALYSIS OF REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN OF  SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS 
In developing this system, steps are taken namely: conducting a needs analysis, making  system design/design, coding, then implementation and testing. In developing this system,  steps are taken namely: conducting a needs analysis, making system design/design,  coding, then implementation and testing. Needs analysis is done with data collection using  google related to the system geographic information of cities. The next step in developing  this system is making system design. The system design is described with the diagram as  shown in Figure 2. System users are web visitors and the function it can do is search the  shortest route and book the cab between them. If the user wants to find the shortest route,  so the user must type one place of origin and one place of destination which are desired  and than enter the details for cab booking. If all the design has been done, then proceed to check whether the system designed in terms of distance or weight is working or not. 

IMPLEMENTATION 
To use the program, it's simple enough to just access and then just look for cities in India or  on the map that has been provided then type in the start and end. 

CONCLUSION 
From the development and testing, and validation of the system that has been carried out in  connection with the search for the shortest route and book cab between them by using  Dijkstra's algorithm on cities can provide. Dijkstra's algorithm is good enough to use on the  shortest route search from and to cities in India
